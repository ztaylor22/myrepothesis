## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
getSymbols("TSLA", from="2022-7-27", to="2022-9-4", periodicity="daily", src="yahoo")
#quantmod's getSymbols function only works with daily, weekly, and monthly
chartSeries(TSLA, theme=chartTheme("white"))
#addMACD() What does this line do?
summary(cars)
```
```{r}

#ticker <- "GM"
#date_from <- "2022-7-27"
#date_to <- "2022-9-4"
#frequency <- "daily"

StockDataIteration <- function(ticker, date_from, date_to, frequency)
{
  getSymbols(ticker, from=date_from, to=date_to, periodicity=frequency, src="yahoo")
  chart <- chartSeries(ticker, theme=chartTheme("white"))
  return(chart)

}
```

```{r}
StockDataIteration("GM","2022-7-27","2022-9-4","daily")
#Need to do some research on writing functions in R
#Need to then create a for loop where all of this data is added to a datatable as a new column
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
